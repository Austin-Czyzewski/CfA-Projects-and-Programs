# CfA-Projects-and-Programs
This is all programs developed by me during my summer internship at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

There is not much here because much of my research was done in a seperate code, CMS2 (Coronal Modelling Software 2).
This was simply some scripts to evaluate some of the data the CMS2 produced.

Note: I am relatively new to developing programs so feedback is encouraged. Especially in regards to creating a well documented code.

Additionally, I am always looking for new tricks to improve run-time and shorten the length of my code so if anything is sticking out to you that allows for easy changes along these lines that feedback there would be appreciated.
