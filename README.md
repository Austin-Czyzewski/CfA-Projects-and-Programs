# CfA-Projects-and-Programs
This is all programs developed by me during my summer internship at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.


Note: I am relatively new to developing programs so feedback is encouraged. Especcially in regards to creating a well documented code.
Additionally, I am always looking for new tricks to improve run-time and shorten the length of my code so if anything is sticking out to you that allows for easy changes along these lines that feedback there would be appreciated.
